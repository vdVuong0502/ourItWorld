                    shouldn't even cause a blip in the progress of our project at all. Every
                    member of the team is responsible for each part of the project, and at the
                    end of each day, we discuss what we've accomplished and make plans for the

                    By understanding each member’s strengths and weaknesses, they are
                    distributed into which parts and tasks are suitable the most for them. That

            researcher or AI application developer, while Kang has not yet made a
            decision. Each member's desired employment is connected to the information
            technology (IT) area. However, they are still distinct from one another.
            Dung's mission is to assist the company in identifying as many
            vulnerabilities as possible, thereby eliminating the risk of future
            assaults by repairing them. Sang's job requires him to do more research and
            work with algorithms in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) or the use
            of AI in real-world applications like virtual support or autonomous
            driving. Kang is willing to get a master's degree to fulfill his
            professional responsibilities or to transmit his expertise to future
            generations.

            <p>
                ● Traffic Clog is the primary concern of the rapid and growing planet. Due
                to the growth in the usage of more private automobiles and insufficient
                road network capacity controlling traffic using the old technique is
                onerous. Traffic has a significant impact on both pollution and individual
                productivity. Variable traffic congestion may not be effectively and
                significantly resolved by the use of conventional procedures. Today,
                artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) play a significant
                role in the resolution of several real-world issues. Therefore, to handle
                this challenge, our group come up with the idea that utilising the
                application of artificial intelligence and machine learning. This can be
                the vehicle that leads us to the best answers. An AI-enabled traffic
                management system may provide cars with more freedom by allowing them to be
                more directed and controlled by their external surroundings. The primary
                objective of AI is to reduce manual interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                ● The manual management of traffic congestion has been shown to be both
                unsuccessful and time-consuming. It is feasible to overcome the
                shortcomings of the manual technique by using automotive technology and
                other adaptive technologies. It is hard to provide an exact estimate of the
                amount of congestion that will be present at a particular place due to the
                occurrence of unpredictable events. The key challenges associated with
                anticipating traffic congestion include a lack of capacity, uncontrolled
                demand, and predetermined times for the length of traffic signals. Thus, we
                need to maximize the traffic flow at the intersections and minimize the
                waiting time using AI applications in the systems to identify and manage
                the flow of traffic easily.

                ● Reduce or eliminate driver-caused automobile accidents:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p> Driver mistake is the leading cause of automobile accidents. Humans are too obstinate not to drive
                        when
                        distracted, inebriated, high, or tired, therefore it should not come as a surprise. The apparent
                        answer
                        to
                        such unsafe driver behavior is to give the wheel to something incapable of becoming distracted,
                        inebriated,
                        high, or sleepy as people do when driving. Consequently, vehicle autonomy is necessary. Self-driving
                        cars
                        are outfitted with state-of-the-art cameras, sensors, and radars to assess their surroundings and
                        other
                        road
                        users in order to foresee the unexpected in ways that our limited and inferior senses could never
                        do.
                        These
                        future automobiles and trucks also respond faster to potential dangers. Moreover, vehicle-to-vehicle
                        connectivity might allow them to instantly share information and notify one another of surrounding
                        threats.</p>

                <li>
                    <p> Vehicles driven by AI may operate on gasoline or electricity, but they are fuelled by data.
                        Intelligent automobiles and trucks continuously collect data that, with the application of
                        appropriate analytics, may provide actionable insights. Transport interests may utilize these
                        insights to determine which parts of the road are intrinsically hazardous for one reason or another,
                        allowing them to design safer routes for motorists.</p>

                    <p> During rush hours, there is a great deal of traffic jams and accidents in HCM City, which causes
                        transportation challenges for many residents. Due to working hours and finish times, a large number
                        of residents used transportation at this time. AI-based traffic control systems are the subject of
                        our discussion. It employs AI to handle traffic control systems. The traffic, people, roads, and
                        timings of the transportation network can all be correctly anticipated and managed by artificial
                        intelligence. In addition, AI provides the most efficient means of transportation, hence enhancing
                        customer service. We were encouraged to tackle this topic because we have expertise with traffic,
                        and we want to build AI solutions that will assist the inhabitants of HCM City in finding a solution
                        to the traffic problem and reducing the number of accidents. </p>

                        ● There are several contenders for AI applications in traffic management at
                        now. Such as autonomous cars, intelligent traffic signals, traffic flow
                        analysis, intelligent traffic management and monitoring systems, artificial
                        intelligence (AI) cameras, intelligent parking, and driver monitoring. Our
                        efforts are similar; we integrate the majority of them to produce AI-based
                        traffic management with two subsystems:
                    </p>

                        <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                            <p>
                                ▪ The traffic control system which includes the transportation controllers
                                attached to the vehicles and the traffic lights controllers. Using
                                intelligent cameras, driver monitoring, and self-driving vehicles allows
                                communication between vehicles and systems hand in hand.

            </ul>
    
            <p>However, this is still the concept behind our project. We are unable to compete against all of our
                competitors owing to a lack of human resources and infrastructure, as well as finances, and all of these
                things are compounded by the fact that we have a restricted amount of knowledge.</p>

            We aim to create a traffic control system that uses AI technology to reduce
            traffic jams and car accidents. Our AI Traffic control system will analyze
            various real-life factors such as population, road conditions, time, etc.
            and make predictions to allow the most optimal flow of traffic in any given
            condition.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will make this work with the following functions:

                <p>

                    weather condition, and time of day. This will be done by retrieving
                    available online data, some personal data necessary such as current
                    location, and camera real-time images to process and detect the number of
                    vehicles per amount of time. will be retrieved through the user’s phone or

                    analyze and create a decision and prediction to give the user the best
                    option while on the road, change the light signal at the appropriate time
                    of the day, and demonstrate the data in chart format.

            Having been experiencing the horrible traffic in Ho Chi Minh City helped us come up with an idea to bring down
            the situation. With the rise of machine learning in many industries lately, we thought that we could apply it to
            analyze the traffic situation and give predictions, and decisions about the traffic lights’ time, and control
            autonomous cars. The team conducted much research about the applications of AI in this field, what we had
            already been able to do and what we could do with our knowledge at the time. We spent the first week discussing
            the scope, and sometimes we argued, but I believed it only made our decision more insightful and accurate.
            Finally, we could decide what we want our system to do. We wanted to divide the system into 3 main parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <p>
                    ● The first part will be a subsystem attached to a car to take information about the speed, nearby
                    objects, and vehicles, and the distance between them. It will combine all this information, make
                    predictions, and automatically control the car.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <p>
                    ● As for the second part, we planned to attach cameras at each intersection, use a deep learning
                    algorithm to detect and study the vehicle flows, then calculate and give the most accurate time.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <p>
                    ● The third part will be a central control system to monitor each intersection and the data at 2 other
                    subsystems sent, then it will generate charts and results to demonstrate to the supervisors. We also
                    want to create a private server for these subsystems to communicate to provide the most precise
                    conclusions.
                </p>
            </li>
    
        </ul>
        <p>
            We then quickly made a plan in order to bring this idea to life. We agreed that this project is not a small one
            and there were many things we didn’t know regarding AI, hardware, and network, so we planned to create the
            prototype of the system and the functions for the first phase. We spent the next week researching and listing
            down the tools and technologies that might involve. This is a machine learning-based project, so when we thought
            of the tools the first thing that came to our mind was Python. There are many reasons: it has a powerful math
            library to help us calculate the predictions; it has a lot of modules that help process machine-learning
            algorithms; it is greatly supported by the community etc. But the most important reason was we all knew Python
            beforehand. It would take less effort to learn the language and allow us to focus on researching other
            technologies and algorithms. After having decided on the language, we started to dig into the libraries we would
            need for this project. As expected, since the language is highly supported for machine learning, we took no time
            to list down all the packages and technologies. Those included MySQL (for storing processed data for each
            intersection and vehicle that were registered); NumPy, Keras, and TensorFlow (for image processing and AI
            training), and Pandas (for creating data charts). Since we will be coding together, we decided that each member
            should grasp how to use every tool. We thought it would only take us 2 weeks. However, after the first few days,
            we realized that each of these tools and technologies might be hard for newcomers, so we made a new arrangement:
            every member needed to know the basics of all the tools, but each will specialize in different ones. In the end,
            it took us nearly 3 weeks to be able to learn what we planned.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were behind the schedule, so we decided to split the jobs. One person will design the UI for the command
            system,
            one will design the system architecture and the other two will research all the algorithms involving the
            project,
            and all must be done in 2 weeks. It was at that moment, we got horrible news, which is that one member of our
            team
            decided to withdraw. We were short-staffed, but the project had to go on. We had to learn the left member’s
            specialized technologies and take up more work. It never rains but it pours, and we hit another wall. More
            precisely, it was our mistake in the first place, we should have investigated the automatically controlled cars.
            In
            order to archive the autonomous state, we need to perform the neural network method in deep learning and use an
            ADAS
            (Advanced Driver Assistance System). To do this, the hardware requirements are high. Moreover, ADAS is much
            beyond
            our budget and scope. We had to change our scope. All the functions regarding controlling the car and making
            driving
            decisions were removed. Thus, the scope became much smaller and more achievable. The system will still contain 3
            parts:
        </p>
    
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <p>
                    ● The first part will just collect the car’s state such as speed, nearby objects, vehicles, and distance
                    between them. Receiving response from server and display notifications on the screen
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <p>
                    ● The second part will not have any change.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                <p>
                    ● The third part will have an additional function, which is posting the processed data and charts so
                    that these data can be used by other applications to update the city traffic news to other people.
            </li>
    
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            Assembling the server is not in the scope so we planned to hire a cloud server to run some machine learning
            algorithms, respond to other parts and store processed data.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Stepping into the world of AI turned out to be much harder than we thought since we do not have the required
            knowledge in both the IT and machine learning fields. Although we quickly finish the UI design (which contains a
            main screen with small windows to display the current situation at every intersection. Users can click on a
            window to zoom in. This UI will contain a menu for users to switch pages to view analyzed data and charts.) and
            the system architecture (after having modified the scope), we needed nearly a month to read through all the
            material we found, and finally, we were able to list down some of the most effective algorithms that we can make
            and suitable components to use. Still, which one to use is the question that we cannot answer when we haven’t
            really implemented these functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having all the information that we needed, we then got our hands on making the first prototype. The trouble in
            the past made our work more effective this time. We created a prototype, which you can view later in this
            report, that demonstrates the UI of the command control system and provides the clearest vision of how the whole
            program will work. After that, we wrote this report with all the project descriptions that we believed not only
            will be a useful document when explaining the project to people who are not from the field but will also be a
            reference document for us to make sure the project is still on the right track (or any other team might take up
            on this project if we are not able to complete it).

                                ● An algorithm is a collection of rules designed to solve a particular issue. Designing and
                                analyzing algorithms is an essential component of AI technology. It must be efficient in
                                terms of the amount of time necessary to process a large quantity of input data.
                                Additionally, the effectiveness of an algorithm will be determined by its memory use. Big O
                                notation is the most well-known approach to assessing an algorithm. In an ideal environment,
                                the number of operations remains constant as the volume of data rises. However, this cannot
                                be accomplished in real-time. In a scenario with a basic algorithm, the quantity of input
                                data and operations rises at a constant pace. In complex algorithmic situations, the number
                                of operations and calculations is expressed in terms of polynomial time (X2), exponential
                                time (2X), and factorial time (X!) [1]. In transportation, data may be acquired from a

                            Then, the similarity between real-time data and sample data is evaluated.

                            <strong>ANN:</strong> The artificial neural network (ANN) technique is used to recognize the
                            non-linear connection between input and output characteristics and to propose generalized
                            solutions for traffic volume forecasting. At each epoch, the error is estimated by comparing the
                            computed output of each input to the predicted output. Backpropagation is the most common error
                            propagation method. A random weight is first allocated to each processing unit. In the training,
                            cross-validation, and testing stages, the primary aim of the neural network optimization
                            procedure is to decrease the mean square error. We evaluate the efficacy of the ANN model for
                            short-term traffic prediction under mixed traffic scenarios.

                        relevant to the area of AI, they have not delved too deeply into the subject matter. Thanks to this
                        research, every one of us will have the opportunity to not only get a fundamental understanding of
                        the role that AI plays in the management of traffic but also to have an insight into the algorithms
                        themselves.

                        Based on the scope of our project, we will divide the testing into 3 phases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first one will be conducted along with the development of the software functions. We will test
                        the machine learning algorithms for analyzing and predicting traffic flows with a collection of
                        sample data that we are planning to collect to see if they give us correct results in an efficient
                        amount of time. Due to busy traffic in Ho Chi Minh City, and the expectation that the system will
                        report real-time results, we hope these algorithms can work out the conclusion in under 2 seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second phase will be put into action when we finish the algorithms. In this phase, we will test
                        if the hardware components we choose work well and are able to communicate through the private
                        network and send data to the cloud server. We need data on how fast the connection is, how the
                        weather condition will affect the results given by the components, and what is the minimum
                        requirements of the cloud server to be able to process the data in the given amount of time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, we will test the system on the streets. This phase will be the hardest. We will need
                        permission from the local government and residents to be able to collect camera data at
                        intersections. Moreover, we will have to rent cars and assemble the needed components, drive them
                        through the city’s streets to collect real-time data, then analyze the data to have the system
                        modified if needed before putting it to work. At this phase, we will need volunteers to test the UI
                        of the command program. We aimed to create a UI that required minimal training to use it. Therefore,
                        we can invite non-trained users such as friends, families, or students because they are most likely
                        to be found. We will let them use the beta version of the command system and give them a survey to
                        evaluate it based on their experience.

                            and must temporarily or permanently withdraw from the project. This will affect the pace of our

                            As a matter of fact, the fully autonomous automobile has not yet evolved, and the limitations of
                            AI sensor technologies are unavoidable. Therefore, when it comes to ethical concerns, there is
                            no possibility for such vehicle tracking systems to become a reality one day. To accurately
                            address this situation, it is essential to perceive the philosophical concept called “the
                            trolley problem/dilemma”.
                        </p>

                            The research showed most of the people who were asked, tended to turn the trolley, and prevent
                            five deaths at the cost of one. This led to the scientists’ confusion, as they found it
                            difficult to comprehend what makes it right to put the priority of five people’s lives over one.
                            For humans, this kind of thinking takes thousands of years to develop and become our reasoning
                            style. Neuroscientists are continually finding new truths about the human brain and its logical
                            processes. Teaching the computer what is ethically right or wrong or transmitting the notion of
                            emotional thinking is determined to be impossible to accomplish.

                            taught to the machine via coding and programming, a task reserved for science fiction.

                            One of the prominent features that help traffic signs be distinctive is their unique colours,
                            which differentiate them from background information and facilitate identification. However, in
                            outdoor conditions, illumination changes have a significant impact on the colour of traffic
                            signs. Therefore, detecting traffic signs would be complex under those circumstances.

                            In some circumstances where we were forced to have the meeting online, we used Discord, because
                            of its useful functions such as screen and file sharing, and higher call quality, and because it
                            is the program that allows the closest experience to an in person meeting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Outside of meetings, we used Facebook Messenger for short communications and such. We chose to
                            use Messenger because it is a communication medium that we all already use.

                            At one point, a group member was completely unresponsive, and one team member attempted to
                            contact him and found out that, for whatever reason, he’d quit the group without notifying us.
                            So, the three of us had another meeting and re-distributed our workloads to cover for the member
                            that quit.

        <p>We’ve made a simple system design diagram to demonstrate what functions it may have and how the parts work
            together:</p>
        <figure>
            <div>
                <img src="architech.png" alt="software architecture" width="100%">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center">Fig.1 - System design.</figcaption>
            </div>
        </figure>
        <ul>
            <p>- The cloud server we hired to run all the machine learning algorithms and data processing algorithms.</p>
            <p>- The subsystem in a car: A raspberry Pi will collect the data from a camera attached to the car (to
                recognize nearby vehicles), speed, and other objects (using IR sensors), then send those data to the server.
                Then receive the response and display it on the screen or by voice.</p>
            <p>- Traffic light controller: collect real-time video on the road, send it to server, receive the processed
                video and the signal for the traffic light.</p>
            <p>- And finally, the master control system, can be used to monitor all the cameras’ status and locations of
                those cameras. It can also display the traffic situation predicted by the server in the form of charts.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Below is the prototype of the UI design for the master controller. The other 2 subsystems will only work in the
            backend so there is no UI design for them.
        </p>
    
        <figure>
            <div>
                <img src="Control_home.png" alt="control system home screen" width="100%">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>
            </div>
        </figure>
    
    <p>
        Firstly, it will display small windows for monitoring the cameras.
    </p>
    
    <figure>
        <div>
            <img src="Camera_list_view.png" alt="control system list view" width="100%">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>
        </div>
    </figure>
    <p>
        If users cannot find the road, they can turn on the list as below. It will show them each camera location. They
        can also search the cameras on the road they want to find.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <div>
            <img src="Control_Detail.png" alt="control system zoom in" width="100%">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>
        </div>
    </figure>
    <p>
        They can click into 1 window, the system will zoom in on that window. They can click on the screen again to go
        back.
    </p>
    <figure>
        <div>
            <img src="Chart_view.png" alt="control system zoom in" width="100%">
            <figcaption style="text-align: center"></figcaption>
        </div>
    </figure>
    <p>
        Finally, they can view the charts that I mentioned.
    </p><br>
    <p>
        We believe with the carefully calculated data, we will be able to control the traffic lights, distance, and
        speed of vehicles, and with the monitor system. It may help people from pushing each other on the road, reduce
        traffic jams, and help drivers to make better driving decisions. With all the real-time information, the
        residents can know which road is crowded at the moment and choose to take other roads.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system now lacks the ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). We want to have this to apply autonomous
        driving, but the knowledge and budgets do not allow us to do this. So in the future, when we learn more about AI
        training and get some funding from other investors, we hope to add this feature to bring the original idea back
        to this project.

        <p>
            While we were already in the middle of working on the project, we had an unexpected turn of events, as one
            of our group members quit without notifying us. However, we didn’t let this interfere with our progress, and
            quickly adjusted to this change by re-distributing each member’s workload and rearranging the tasks. Besides
            the one member that quit, we believe our collaboration and teamwork skills were some of the things that went
            as well as they could have gone.
        </p>
        <p>
            One thing we had a challenge with was that we set the goals too high. At first, we had overestimated our
            capabilities and planned on creating functions in our project that we realize now were impossible to create
            with our current skills and knowledge. Naturally, we had to make some compromises and give up on some of the
            functionalities that were not feasible. We learned that the next time we go on about a project, we should
            first see if we are capable of actually making the product on our own.
        </p>
        <p>
            During our project, we were surprised to learn that AI technology was much more advanced than we thought. We
            were amazed to see that AI was already performing so many of the tasks that could only be done by humans and
            the sheer hold AI already had on society.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, the project seemed impossible to do, but we learned that with effort and teamwork, even the most
            difficult of tasks were possible. Another thing we learned was the importance of collaboration. After
            finishing the project, we could see that we couldn’t have pulled this project off on our own, and working as
            a team made things a lot easier.
        </p>
    </ul>
    
    
    <span><strong>Pham Phuoc Sang (s3975979)</strong></span>
    <ul>
        <p>
            During our project's development, an unanticipated circumstance led one of our team members to abandon this
            course without alerting us until I inquired about it. Nonetheless, this unexpected occurrence cannot allow
            us to halt our development. Again, we reprocessed and redistributed each member's task. I anticipated this
            catastrophe might significantly impede our development and throw everything into disarray. However, thanks
            to our collaboration and effort on this project, we can maintain the expected rate of advancement.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was unprepared for the fact that we set our group project's objective at a level that made it impossible
            to produce the desired end and prototype. Initially, I believed that we would be able to provide a result
            for this, but the needs of the project were out of control, making it almost impossible with just three
            people remaining. The function, algorithms, and infrastructure requirements are beyond the group’s
            capability. To learn from experience, I will establish a target based on the group skills for the next
            assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything has two sides; despite the high goal, I discovered a lot of things that I did not know. This
            understanding and the powers of AI astound me. AI was a highly sophisticated technology that could do a
            variety of jobs requiring human thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, the project results and prototype seem unachievable, but I have learned that collaboration
            and effort may make things easier than working alone.
        </p>
    </ul>
    
    <span><strong>Vuong Viet Dung (s3878281)</strong></span>
    <ul>
        <p>
            I can say that the group works together smoothly. The tasks were divided well and the deadline we set for
            each other was appropriate. Moreover, the team members are all responsible that always finishing their work
            before the deadline with excellent quality. They also were helpful to each other. Not only they checked
            others’ parts, but also did they offer help even if other people did not ask for any.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I believe there is always space for improvement. For example, we could have drawn the software
            architecture first to really visualize hose the system will be constructed, so that we can see if there are
            any holes in the scope we made. In addition to that, I think my presentation skills need to be improved
            because presenting projects to investors is such an important part of this career.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working on this project really gave me wonderful knowledge. For example, I didn’t know we have to plan this
            much before starting a project. Moreover, after we thought the plan was excellent, many problems can come up
            and we will have to change many things such as the scope, timetable, etc. I was also surprised that being a
            developer, I may also need to know a bit about designing and how to operate some basic image editing
            software to make prototypes and demos for the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had the chance to work with excellent people, knowing their backgrounds, personalities, and especially
            their career plan and interest. Knowing this may also help me in my learning and career path. Knowing their
            interest, they and I may find some common and attend courses together, help each other in the future, and
            know more about the jobs others are pursuing.
